abstract: The spreading of disinformation throughout the web has become a critical
  problem for a democratic society. The dissemination of fake news has become a profitable
  business and a common practice among politicians and content producers. On the other
  hand, journalists and fact-checkers work unceasingly to debunk misinformation and
  prevent it from further spreading. In 2015, a new web markup called ClaimReview
  has been introduced to grant access to the fact-checking article's meaning by search
  engines. It is an important initiative to fight fake news by promoting and highlighting
  fact-check articles among users. However, barely half of them have adopted the ClaimReview
  markup so far, resulting in low findability of fact-check articles, especially in
  under-represented countries and languages. In this work, we investigate the viability
  of using Artificial Intelligence for generating ClaimReview automatically. Besides
  promoting fact-check articles, the automatic generating of ClaimReview is an important
  step towards the creation of an updated multilingual knowledge base for fighting
  disinformation. Our experiments show noticeable results, which indicate a viable
  solution in a production environment. Furthermore, this work has created a benchmark
  that can be used in upcoming investigations in this domain.
